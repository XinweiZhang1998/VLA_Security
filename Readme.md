## Overview and Contents
1. [Backdoor/Poisoning](#backdoorpoisoning) — Hidden triggers or poisoned data cause targeted misbehavior under specific conditions.
2. [Patch Attacks](#patch-attacks) — Physical or digital patches steer perception and downstream actions.
3. [Adversarial Attacks](#adversarial-attacks) — Crafted inputs or prompts induce failures without changing model weights.
4. [Robustness/Sensor Attacks](#robustnesssensor-attacks) — Physical or sensor-level variations stress the perception-action pipeline.
5. [Defense](#defense) — Methods that improve robustness through training, filtering, or detection.
6. [Benchmarks](#benchmarks) — Datasets and evaluation suites for VLA security and robustness.
